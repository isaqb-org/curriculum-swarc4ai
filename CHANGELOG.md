# Release Notes
## New in 2024.1

This is the first Release of the new advanced module SWArch4AI. The first Release describes the curriculum in german only. 

The module contains modern software architecture concepts for AI systems as a means of designing powerful, scalable and integrable AI solutions.
At the end of the module, participants will be familiar with the essential principles of software architecture for AI systems and can apply these
design and implementation principles for machine learning and generative AI systems.
With the help of the modeling techniques and architecture tools, they can integrate AI components
seamlessly into existing software systems. The course covers both
machine learning systems as well as generative AI and teaches how these can be combined with classic software systems. The participants
learn what the architecture for such hybrid systems must look like in order to ensure
ensure scalability, maintainability and extensibility.

The advanced module is structured as follows (german headlines): 

1. Einführung in softwarearchitekturrelevante Konzepte für Künstliche Intelligenz
2. Compliance, Security, Alignment
3. Entwurf und Entwicklung von KI-Systemen
4. Datenmanagement und Datenverarbeitung für KI-Systeme
5. Wichtige Qualitätsmerkmale für den Betrieb von KI-Systemen
6. Systemarchitekturen- und Plattformen für Generative KI-Systeme
7. Fallstudien und Praxisprojekte


We have tried to cover the current state of modern AI systems, while leaving room for the latest developments to be integrated into the training materials. The aim of this module is not to train machine learning or GenAI experts, but rather to provide the essential skills for designing AI systems and integrating them with classical software systems. After this first release, we will continue to improve and adapt the curriculum to make it a useful module for participants.
